# Machine learning algorithms for regression view (Python)

## Description
This code shows several machine learning algorithms in-depth for a random regression dataset. I made this because I wanted to see each algorithms sensitivity against over/underfitting. The main library that I'm using is SK-learn which is for python. Take also into account that I built this in collab from Google. The structures is as follows:
1) libraries installation, imports, etc.
2) Definition of a random dataset
3) Drive mounting
4) Random dataset generation
5) Linear regression algorithm
6) KNN
7) SVR
8) SVR - kernel sensitivity
9) Decision tree model
10) Decision tree model - Sample split sensitivity
11) Decision tree model - Leaf's sensitivity
12) Random forest model
13) Gradient boosting

## How to install this
1) Download the code
2) Open it in google colab. I didn't try with Jupyter but I guess that should be more or less the same. As far as I had just checked, this guy made it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80dn0PiN_U&ab_channel=TechTips

## How to tweak this code
There are several point to tweek. You can see at the beggining of each section how it is made.


## Found a bug?
Please let us know by writing it down and your thoughts about what caused that bug. Try to explain as much as you can. It will be very appreciate it

## Work in progress
I'm thinking about adding ensembled learning techniques actually.
